# Logic of Differentiable Logics in Coq

This repository contains the formalization of the Logic of
Differentiable Logics (LDL) using the Coq proof-assistant and the
Mathematical Components library.

The LDL language is defined in `ldl.v`, along with its fuzzy, DL2, STL
and Boolean interpretations.  The files `fuzzy.v`, `dl2.v`,
`dl2_ereal.v`, `stl.v` and `stl_ereal.v` contain the relevant theorems
that hold for each interpretation: structural properties (idempotence,
commutativity and associativity of operators), soundness, and
shadow-lifting.
